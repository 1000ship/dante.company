    "faqs_0_question": "Are you open to employment?",
    "faqs_0_answer": "<p>First of all, I'd like to thank everyone who offers me a job description. However, at the moment, I am not interested in employment!</p><p>I prefer a flexible working style in my own time and place, so I usually contract on a project-by-project basis with a set end date.</p>",
    "faqs_1_question": "What are the benefits of working with you?",
    "faqs_1_answer": "<p>The biggest advantage of solo development is minimizing the time wasted on communication and authority requests. Especially, smaller companies tend to prioritize producing products quickly for market validation, and in this case, working with me would be more satisfactory.</p><p>Even without full-time commitment, I am confident I can do the job faster and at a more reasonable cost than hiring a front-end and back-end full-time developer at average salary. üòé</p>",
    "faqs_2_question": "What are the disadvantages of working with you?",
    "faqs_2_answer": "<p>If you need responses to real-time requests or have long meeting times, working with me could be difficult. Unfortunately, like everyone else, I only have 24 hours a day üò¢</p><p>I usually only have a remote meeting for 30 minutes to 1 hour per week, and points of discussion or plan requests are communicated asynchronously by message.</p>",
    "faqs_3_question": "Do we need a designer?",
    "faqs_3_answer": "<p>Work can be done perfectly fine even without a designer! I have worked on more projects without a designer so far. In these cases, I modify and use my own components and purchased UI templates appropriately. The page you are looking at now is created by me.</p><p>Rather, if you have a specific design in mind, the workload increases because publishing work is needed. Of course, if you need illustration work, you will need a designer!</p><p>If you point out what you like with a URL or captured image of another website, such as color or layout structure, it will communicate well with me!</p>",
    "faqs_4_question": "Can you handle animation freely?",
    "faqs_4_answer": "<p>That's a confident part. It depends on what animation you want, but generally, it's possible! If you express the feeling you want abstractly, I work by implementing it initially and gradually modifying it.</p>"
