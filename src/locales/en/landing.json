    "faqs_0_answer": "<p>First of all, I'd like to thank everyone who offers me a job description. However, at the moment, I am not interested in employment!</p><p>I prefer a flexible working style in my own time and place, so I usually contract on a project-by-project basis with a set end date.</p>",
    "faqs_1_question": "What are the benefits of working with you?",
    "faqs_1_answer": "<p>The biggest advantage of solo development is minimizing the time wasted on communication and authority requests. Especially smaller companies tend to prioritize the fast pace due to market validation. In this case, I will be faster and more reasonable price than having both a front-end and back-end full-time developer with an average salary. üòé</p>",
    "faqs_2_question": "What are the disadvantages of working with you?",
    "faqs_2_answer": "<p>Working with me could be difficult if you expect 24/7 responses or long-time meetings. Unfortunately, like everyone else, I only have 24 hours a day. üò¢</p><p>I usually have a remote meeting for 30 minutes to 1 hour per week. Most of the discussion points or plan requests are communicated asynchronously by message.</p>",
    "faqs_3_question": "Do we need a designer?",
    "faqs_3_answer": "<p>Work can be done perfectly free, even without a designer! I have worked on more projects without a designer so far. In these cases, I appropriately modified and used my own components and purchased UI templates. I fully created the page that you are on right now.</p><p>If you have a specific design in mind, the workload will increase due to a publishing step. Of course, if you need illustration work, you will need a designer!</p><p>If you have an example URL or captured images from other websites, such as color or layout structure, our communication will be easier!</p>",
    "faqs_4_question": "Can you handle animation freely?",
    "faqs_4_answer": "<p>That's a confident part. It depends on what animation you want, but generally, it's possible! If you express the abstract feeling you want, I will implement it first and gradually modify it.</p>"
